# Experiments: Surgery
Here we describe the fields of the experimental template for surgery.

Please note: the functionality of entry via the eLabFTW is very limited to unavailabilty of checks and processing of 
entered data. So consider using the [SurgeryCommander](../gui_documentation/SurgeryCommander.md).

If you enter surgery information using eLabFTW, only the animalsheetentry about the surgery will be created. However, 
no transfer of coordinates, calculation of target coordinates, brain area, connection of experiments with this animal 
to the virus etc is possible.

Okay.. you still insist on entering it via eLabFTW ?

Please you the main text fields to enter your coordinates and angles, as well as details about the injection,
and implanted thingy. While those things will not be pushed to DB they still be documented in eLabFTW.

Even better, you link the used virus(es) using the link resource field.
