# Guide for eLabFTW Administrators
Collection of guides for the administrators. **Manual**:
<https://doc.elabftw.net/admin-guide.html>

Your powers as an Admin:

- Has access to the Admin Panel with settings impacting only their team
- Can validate/archive users of their team
- Can edit available Categories and Status for Experiments and Resources of their team
- Can edit the default experiments template
- Can manage groups of users amongst the team
- Can change the rightmost link in the main menu (is pointing to our our documentation already)
- Can archive users. Archiving users means disable login for that account, and lock all experiments.

## Confirm users
Any new [registered](register_login.md) user needs to be validated before being granted access.
