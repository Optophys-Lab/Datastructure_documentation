# How to _add a perfusion of existing animal_

To add a perfusion to the DB for subsequent use there are 3 ways.

Requirements:
- animal already exist in the DB
- not marked as dead yet

1. Use [WeightCommander](../gui_documentation/WeightCommander.md) THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET !!
2. Entry using the [Perfusion-experiment](../eLabFTW_documentation/experiment_perfusion.md) 
3. Use hardcore python to entry to DB.AnimalDeath TODO reference jupyter tutorials

Any additional information to add ? Perfusion solution, details etc.
After creating the perfusion entry using any of the methods you can go to eLabFTW and add all this information to the 
corresponding entry.
