# How to add a water deprivation

Requirements:
- animal is already in DB


1. Use [WeightCommander](../gui_documentation/WeightCommander.md) THIS is the most comfortable way. 
2. Entry using the [Waterdeprivation-experiment](../eLabFTW_documentation/experiment_waterdep.md).
3. Use hardcore python to entry to DB.AnimalSheetEntry and DB.ZWR TODO reference jupyter tutorials

You would like to add a bunch of animals at the same time ? well, maybe at some point there will be code to do that.
