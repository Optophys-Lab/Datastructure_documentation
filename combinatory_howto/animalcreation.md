# How to add a new animal

To add a new animal to the DB for subsequent use there are 3 ways.

Requirements:
- you are added as user to DB, [if not](../gui_documentation/AdminCommander.md#adding-users) 
- TVA you want is already in DB [if not](../combinatory_howto/tva.md) 
- Animal type is already in DB
- You know the TVA, genotype/strain, delivery date, age at delivery, sex, number, and the source of the animal

Your options:
1. Use [AnimalCommander](../gui_documentation/AnimalCommander.md) 
2. Entry using the [Animal-resource](../eLabFTW_documentation/resource_animal.md) in eLabFTW
3. Use _hardcore_ python to enter to DB.Animal TODO reference jupyter tutorials

You would like to add additional information about your favorite animal (earmarks, picture of you and the animal, drawing, etc.)?
drawing, etc.) ?
After you have created the animal using one of the methods, you can go to eLabFTW and add all this information to the 
corresponding record.
