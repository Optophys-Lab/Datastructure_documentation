# How to _add a new animal_

To add a new animal to the DB for subsequent use there are 3 ways.

Requirements:
- you are added as user to DB, [if not](../gui_documentation/AdminCommander.md#adding-users) 
- TVA you want is already in DB 
- Animal type is already in DB
- You know the TVA, genotype/strain, delivery date, age at delivery, sex, number, and the source of the animal

Your options:
1. Use [AnimalCommander](../gui_documentation/AnimalCommander.md) 
2. Entry using the [Animal-resource](../eLabFTW_documentation/resource_animal.md) 
3. Use hardcore python to entry to DB.Animal TODO reference jupyter tutorials

You would like to add additional information about your favorite animal (earmarks, picture of you and the animal,
drawing) ?
After Creating the Animal using any of the methods you can go to eLabFTW and add all this information to the 
corresponding entry.
