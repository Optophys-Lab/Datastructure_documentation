# How to add a new virus or virus-batch

To add a new virus or batch to the DB for subsequent use there are 3 ways.

Requirements:
- you have checked that this virus was not already added to db using a similar name
- you know the titer, delivery date, supplier, opsin, reporter gene, expression promotor, etc.

Your options:
1. Use [VirusCommander](../gui_documentation/VirusCommander.md) THIS is the preferred way! 
2. Entry using the [Virus-resource](../eLabFTW_documentation/resource_virus.md). Not all functionality is available here.
3. Use hardcore python to entry to DB.Virus TODO reference jupyter tutorials

You would like to add additional information about your favorite virus (taste, color, aliquoted volume)?
After Creating the entry using any of the methods you can go to eLabFTW and add all this information to the 
corresponding entry.
