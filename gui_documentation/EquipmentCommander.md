# AnimalCommander
GUI for adding Ephys probes with defined electrode configuration and Miniscopes(not implemented yet)
One can create specified geometric arrangement of electrodes in the probe. This cann later be used for spike sorting as 
well as electrode/neuron localization.

## Add new Probe for existing types

The type you want doesnt exist ? create a new one:
## Add new Probe Type
One can create new electrode-type by entering the corresponding values for the electrode arrangengment and nr of shafts 
etc. One can also upload a ProbeInterface file, a library which allows definition of probe geometries and visualization.
The Library also enables using the probe geometries in the spikesorting.
