# SurgeryCommander
This gui allows entering surgeries to the DB.
Beyond the animal documentation aspect of the surgery, this tool enables DB integration of Viruses, Probes and 
coordinates. A surgery can contain one or several individual steps such as injections or implantations.
The tool lets you input the coordinates you used during the surgery (AP/ML on the brain surface) and depth of insertion.
Then using atlas data the tool can automatically calculate where the target is and associate a brain-area with it.

# General surgery entries

Choose the animal

Entry medication and anesthesia details and further details.
# Definition of insertion angles

#TODO if atlas is initialized.. try to upload the image(s) to the eLabFTW
