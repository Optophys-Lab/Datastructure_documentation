# First steps for DataStructure_tools
We have compiled a great set of tools to enable us to work more efficiently and reproducible,
as well as keep out animal documentation up to date.

You would like to start ?
- Please read about [datastructure](../datastructure_documentation/datastructure.md). This explains how we would like to structure data on out server.
- [Install datastructure tools](installation.md). This is python packages with a bunch of tools to be used with our database and file server.
- [Configure those tools](AdminCommander.md#db-configuration)
- [(Optionally) copy atlas files](AdminCommander.md#copy-brain-atlases)
- Happy Science !
